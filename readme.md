# Financial data pipeline

I asked claude to devise a project for me to learn Rust in a distributed system,
emphasizing concurrency. It came up with something cool, so I'm doing it.

The project structure is autogenerated but I'm doing all the implementation myself. Learning is my objective. If claude did the implementation I'd learn nothing.
