# Rust Financial Data Pipeline - Learning Project Context

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Learn Rust fundamentals by building a real-time financial data aggregation pipeline  
**Purpose**: Prepare for backend engineering interview at REDACTED  
**Timeline**: Working through 6 progressive modules at own pace

## What We're Building

A distributed financial data system with these components:
- **Data Ingester** - Simulates real-time market data feeds
- **Stream Processor** - Aggregates and enriches data using Kafka
- **Cache Layer** - Redis for hot data storage  
- **API Gateway** - Serves data via both gRPC and REST
- **Database** - PostgreSQL for persistent storage

## Learning Objectives

### Core Rust Concepts
- [x] Basic syntax, structs, ownership, borrowing
- [x] Parallelism and concurrency patterns
- [x] Async/await and Tokio runtime
- [x] Error handling with Result<T, E>
- [x] Memory safety without garbage collection

### Distributed Systems Concepts  
- [ ] Message queues (Kafka) for event streaming
- [ ] Caching strategies (Redis) for performance
- [ ] Database integration (PostgreSQL) for persistence
- [ ] Load balancing and horizontal scaling
- [ ] Monitoring and observability

### API Design Patterns
- [ ] When to use gRPC vs REST
- [ ] Protocol buffers for type-safe APIs
- [ ] Streaming vs request-response patterns

### Financial System Requirements
- [ ] Precise decimal arithmetic (never floats for money)
- [ ] Time zone handling for global markets
- [ ] Event sourcing and audit trails
- [ ] Low-latency processing for real-time data
- [ ] Compliance and regulatory considerations

## Technical Stack

```toml
# Core dependencies for this project
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }    # Async runtime
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }   # Serialization
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }   # Time handling
uuid = { version = "1.6", features = ["v4"] }        # Unique IDs
rust_decimal = "1.33"                                # Precise arithmetic
anyhow = "1.0"                                       # Error handling

# Additional as we progress
tonic = "0.11"          # gRPC
axum = "0.7"           # REST API
rdkafka = "0.36"       # Kafka client

2. Implement thread-safe aggregators using Arc/Mutex  
3. Explore RwLock for read-heavy workloads
4. Compare performance between channels and shared state approaches

## Interview Preparation Context

**Target Role**: Backend Engineer at REDACTED  
**Key Areas**: Rust, parallelism/concurrency, gRPC vs REST, extreme scale architecture

**Why This Project Helps**:
- Demonstrates hands-on Rust experience beyond toy examples
- Shows understanding of distributed systems patterns
- Covers real financial data processing challenges
- Provides concrete examples for behavioral interview questions
- Builds portfolio project showcasing technical growth

## Key Learnings from Completed Modules

### Module 1 Learnings
- **Ownership**: Rust's move semantics prevent data races at compile time
- **Async/Await**: Futures are lazy and need `.await` to execute
- **Error Handling**: `Result<T, E>` and `?` operator make error propagation explicit
- **Decimal Arithmetic**: Using `rust_decimal` for financial calculations instead of floats

### Module 2 Learnings  
- **Channel Patterns**: 
  - `mpsc` for multi-producer single-consumer scenarios
  - `oneshot` for request-response patterns
  - `broadcast` for coordinating shutdown across components
- **Actor Pattern**: MarketDataHub demonstrates single-threaded state ownership
- **tokio::select!**: Essential macro for handling multiple async operations concurrently
- **Backpressure**: Bounded channels naturally provide flow control
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper coordination prevents data loss

## Development Notes

- Using RustRover IDE with built-in Rust support and debugging
- All code in `financial_data_pipeline/` directory
- Running `cargo check` frequently for fast feedback
- Using `dbg!` macro, RustRover debugger, and tests for debugging
- Committing progress at end of each module
